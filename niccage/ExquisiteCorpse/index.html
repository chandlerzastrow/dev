        <h2 class = "title"> "The Beginning"</h2><p class ="story">There once was a small man named Nic. Just a babe, he was adopted by wolves in raised in the barren tundra of Rhode Island. He was a man that communicated to others either with the loudest yell or the quietest whisper: There was no in between. Both a blessing and a curse, Nic was both loved and hated by the members of his community. He was both a legend and an outcast.</p>

        <p class = "story">
            He was a man marked by his past, after kidnapping the president of the United States and stealing the Declaration of Independence, the world would not forget.

        <p class="story">It's been said that you can hear the faint whispers of Nic through the misty cobblestone roads of Chicago. Rumor has it that he is back, and stronger than ever. Nic hasn't been seen since he defeated the hobbits in the
        great battle of Princeton, 1429 AD. Since then, it's been said that Nic spent his time reflecting about his heroic victories on the dark side of the moon. Nic got his masters in Philosphy at Cambridge, graduating at the top of his class. He then went on to do his residency at Johns Hopkins, where he discovered the meaning of life.  </p>

            <h2 class="title">"The Middle"</h2>

             <p class = "story"> It was a stormy September evening when Nic decided to take a trip to Philadelphia. He was taking a trip to Independence Hall, a second home to him, even though he'd only been there once. It was a blazing day in the city, easily over 98 degrees, but Nic insisted on wearing a large leather trench coat, with military style boots, and a boa constrictor draped across his neck. </p>

              <p class="story">He was on his way to buy, yes, you guessed it, guns. A lot of freaking guns. Oh, and grenades. As he walked by a wall, bullets flew everywhere. He looked out in to the distance to see young children lined up against a wall being shot to their death... screaming in pain... "This isn't my battle", he thinks to himself. He then goes on about his day, like nothing every happened.</p>

              <p class="story">Once he arrived at Independence Hall, completely forgetting about the slaughter he had  previously witnessed, Nic began to climb the steps. The steps of freedom. About half way up, Nic whistled to his pet Bald Eagle, Lucifer, who quickly landed on his shoulder. Together they continued up the freedom steps. Just before Nic and Lucifer reached the doors of Independenc Hall, they heard a voice echo. "WHO DARES ENTER THE HALL". To Nic and Lucifer's suprise, Tom Cruise jumped down before them, ready to strike.</p>
       

            <p class="story">Nic hadn't seen Tom look that crazy since he had jumped on Oprah's couch however many years ago. That is something he would never forget. Just before Tom threw a rapid punch, Nic unveiled opened his trench coat in a ferocious manner. Within the insides of his jacket were two documents: the Declaration of Independence and the Consitution. There was also a receipt for a $300 Chick-fil-A meal, but we'll get to that later. As the documents unfurled, a beam of light shone off of each letter, blinding Tom with a ray of pure beauty. "John Hancock says hey," Nic said in a voice no ordinary man could ever unhear.</p>

            <h2 class="title">"The End"</h2>
            <p class="story">Screams went through the streets of Philadelphia. Painful, dark screams. "Take that you Xenu worshiping fool!". "You'll pay for this. The Teegeeacks will come back and kill you all", screams Tom Cruise, as he runs back to his fudge-packing factory. Cage sees his Chick-fil-a receipt lying on the sidewalk. He walks over and picks it up. "Now it's time to finish what I started".</p>

            <p class="story">Nic dusted off the receipt and tucked it into his back pocket, chuckling to himself. He then hopped on Lucifer, his trusty steed/sidekick, and began to fly. Nic and Lucifer flew for many fortnight, searching. Finally, on the 40th straight night of flying, Nic finally saw it. To the East, the Chick-fil-a Castle peaking over the horizon with the morning sun behind it. Nic began to dive, dive fast. He had finally found Tom Cruise's evil layer, and was back for revenge. </p>

             <p class="story"> Lucifer did a quick barrel-roll and launched Nic into Tom's throne room. He had a job to do. Tom lay there, still blinded by the famous letters of the documents, writhing on the floor, quoting phrases from the Mission Impossible films. Nic walked briskly, receipt in hand, sweat dripping from his brow. And then silence. "I ordered 130 Chick-Fil-A deluxe sandwiches...," he said turning to his pet eagle. "...But I got charged for 131." He winked, and within an instant, Lucifer transformed into a glowing orb of Chick-Fil-A sauce. "No," muttered Tom, defeated and blind. "Let's ride!" said Nic, as the sauce took the form of the Liberty Bell and launched itself at Tom, killing him, but making him oh so flavorful. "Mission accomplished," said Nic, dropping the receipt in a puddle of Chick-Fil-A sauce. The wind swept his hair, like a wild mustang in the fields of Montana. He walked out the door, ready for his next adventure. The end? </p>
